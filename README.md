# change_wallpaper.sh
Script to change wallpaper randomly via cron in DEs that can't do it themselves (Cinnamon and MATE come to mind). 
Could be easily changed to use feh or similar for window managers that don't manage wallpapers. 
- change_wallpaper.sh: Changes a file at random for the window manager to pick up (for Cinnamon and MATE)
- change_wallpaper_jwm.sh: Calls feh to change the wallpaper at a specified interval (for jwm and others)
- change_wallpaper_jwm_2.sh: Uses feh both to randomize and display the wallpaper (for jwm and others)
